My name is Vinay Rautulwar. I have completed my diploma from Ballarpur Institute of Technology, Chandrapur, and I am currently pursuing my B.Tech at Symbiosis Institute, Nagpur.

I have a strong interest in problem-solving and programming, with Python being my favorite programming language. My career goal is to become a Data Engineer after completing my degree. While I understand the general role of a Data Engineer, I am still exploring the specific skills, tools, and technical expertise required to excel in this field.

Apart from academics, I actively participate in various activities, including sports and painting, which help me maintain a balanced lifestyle. I am also learning the French language, as I believe it will contribute to my personal growth and help me improve my communication and soft skills.
